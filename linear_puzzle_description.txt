LINEAR PUZZLE
This is a game for kids where you have big numbered tiles or game pieces.
It is called linear puzzle because you can only put the tiles in a
straight line:

1 - 2 - 3 - 4

we suppose that the tiles are all of the same size. The objective of the
game is, starting from any ordering of the tiles, simply rearrange the
tiles to get some objective order, but there are some restrictions on 
what movements you can perform.
For example, when you have 4 tiles, you can perform the following moves:
- Swap the two lefttmost tiles (position 1 and 2) (Let's call this L
  operation).
- Swap the two center tiles (position 2 and 3)  (C operation)
- Swap the two rightmost tiles (position 3 and 4)   (R operation)

Suppose we want to go from [3,1,2,4] to [1,3,4,2]. We could do it with
the following operations:
- Apply L operation: [3,1,2,4] -> [3,1,4,2]
- Apply R operation: [3,1,4,2] -> [1,3,4,2]
